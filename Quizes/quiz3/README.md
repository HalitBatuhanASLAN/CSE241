# Problem Solution - Check if Array is Sorted in C++

This solution implements the `isSorted` function that checks whether an array of integers is sorted. The function determines if the array is sorted in either ascending or descending order.

## Problem Description
The task is to write a function that:
1. Checks whether the array is sorted in ascending or descending order.
2. Returns `true` if the array is sorted, otherwise returns `false`.

## Solution Explanation
The function works by comparing consecutive elements in the array. It first identifies whether the sorting is ascending or descending by comparing the first and last elements. Then, it iterates through the array to verify if the order is maintained.
