# Problem Solution - String Comparison in C++

This program demonstrates basic string operations and comparisons in C++. It showcases how to assign, compare, and display string variables using standard C++ syntax.

## Problem Description
The task is to work with three string variables and perform the following operations:
1. Assign the value of one string to another.
2. Print the values of the strings.
3. Compare two strings lexicographically (based on alphabetical order).

## Solution Explanation
The solution consists of the following steps:
- **String Assignment**: The string `str3` is assigned the value of `str1`.
- **Display**: The program outputs the values of `str1`, `str2`, and `str3`.
- **Comparison**: The program compares `str1` and `str2` lexicographically. If `str1` is found to be lexicographically smaller than `str2`, a message is displayed.

# Problem Solution - Pre-Increment and Post-Increment in C++

This solution demonstrates how pre-increment and post-increment operations can be implemented using functions in C++. The program defines two functions, `PreIncInt` and `PostIncInt`, which simulate pre- and post-increment behavior on an integer passed by pointer.

## Problem Description
The task is to implement two functions that simulate:
1. **Pre-Increment**: Increment the integer and then return the incremented value.
2. **Post-Increment**: Return the current value of the integer, then increment it.

## Solution Explanation
The solution uses pointers to modify the integer directly. 
- **Pre-Increment**: The function increments the integer first and then returns the incremented value.
- **Post-Increment**: The function stores the current value, increments the integer, and then returns the original (pre-increment) value.
